# 🔢 Sexy Calculator 😎

A fun little calculator built with Python and Tkinter — my first Python project built from scratch! 
I made this to explore how GUIs work, and it turned out to be... sexy 🧠✨

## 🚀 Features

- Basic arithmetic: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`
- Special ops: `**`, `**2`, `*3.14` (hello Pi!)
- Parentheses support `(` and `)`
- Undo (`<-`) and Clear All (`AC`) buttons
- Live output display after hitting `=`
- Catches errors like a boss 😎
